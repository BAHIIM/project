Project Overview
GitHub Profile Analyzer is a web application designed to help developers analyze and visualize their GitHub activity. By integrating with the GitHub API, users can authenticate via GitHub OAuth, fetch their repository and commit data, and view interactive visualizations of their activity.

Features
GitHub OAuth Authentication: Securely log in using your GitHub account.
Profile Data Visualization: View your GitHub profile information, including repositories and commit history.
Interactive Charts: Analyze your coding patterns and contribution frequency through interactive visualizations.
Customizable Reports: Generate reports based on your activity data.

Technologies
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
API Gateway: GitHub API
Deployment: AWS
Alternative Technologies and Trade-offs
Frontend:
Alternative: Angular
Trade-off: Angular provides a robust framework with a strong community, but React.js was chosen for its simplicity and flexibility, which allows for faster development and easier integration with existing JavaScript libraries.
Database:
Alternative: MySQL
Trade-off: MySQL offers strong relational database capabilities, but MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility in handling JSON-like documents and scalability for handling large volumes of GitHub data.

Challenges
Technical Challenge
One of the major technical challenges was linking the site to the database and ensuring proper data persistence. Initially, the backend server failed to establish a connection with the MongoDB instance, causing errors during data storage and retrieval. The challenge required in-depth debugging, reconfiguring database connection settings, and collaborating with the database administration team to adjust network and access permissions.
Non-Technical Challenge
Coordinating the project timeline and managing team morale was a significant non-technical challenge. The database integration issue led to delays, which frustrated the team. We addressed this by reassessing our timeline, redistributing tasks, and improving communication and documentation practices. This helped in maintaining team morale and ensuring continued progress despite setbacks.

Progress
Progress Rating: 6/10
Explanation of Progress Assessment:
Completed Parts: UI development, initial backend setup, partial OAuth integration.
Incomplete Aspects: Full database integration, data persistence, advanced features.
Challenges Faced:
Technical: Database connection issues.
Non-Technical: Project timeline management and team coordination.
